/*
 * Check that app.js and index.html still agree about the page.

 * app.js looks every control up by id once, at module load, into `elements`.
 * A renamed or dropped id therefore fails at the first use with
 * "Cannot read properties of null" — at run time, in a handler, possibly only
 * on the error path. This test catches that statically instead:
 *
 *   - every id app.js asks for exists in index.html
 *   - every `elements.foo` it dereferences is one of the ids it asked for
 *   - both modules parse
 *
 *   node --test test/wiring.test.mjs
